    FIFA 17 & NBA2K16

  </h2>

	<p>
    I love these games because they were straight to the point and the developers didn't try to make them more complex at this point in time. Nowadays, games have so many unnecessary features to the point where they aren't even fun anymore. FIFA 17 was a soccer game, while NBA2K16 was a basketball game, both of which are my favorite sports to play.

  <figcaption> I love the dynamic play of FIFA 17 as it was easy to use, yet it had mutiple challenging levels, making the game intriguing to play.NBA2K16 was a little different because overall players made shots and MyCareer wasn't broken. I can say wholeheartedly that 2K16 was the best 2K of All-Time. </figcaption>
